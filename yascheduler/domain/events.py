"""Domain events for task lifecycle transitions."""
# region MODULE_CONTRACT
# PURPOSE: Record task lifecycle transitions as immutable values so the UoW can dispatch webhooks/handlers without re-querying aggregates.
# SCOPE:
# - DomainEvent base + TaskCreated, TaskAllocated, TaskCompleted, TaskFailed, TaskAbandoned, and the Event union alias.
# - NOT: event dispatch (application.message_bus) or webhook wire format (infra.notifier).
# INVARIANTS: Every event is frozen; task_id is always present. Events are constructed only inside Task transition methods and inside materialize_task (for TaskCreated).
# KEYWORDS: domain event, lifecycle, webhook, TaskCreated, TaskAllocated, TaskCompleted, TaskFailed, TaskAbandoned
