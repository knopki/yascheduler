## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Orchestrator manages producer-consumer loops

The system SHALL provide an `Orchestrator` class that runs 4 producer-consumer
loops. The `Orchestrator` SHALL accept `uow_factory: Callable[[],
AbstractUnitOfWork]`, `gateway: MachineGateway` (Protocol type for all code
paths), `clouds: CloudProvisioner` (Protocol type), `allocation_tracker:
AllocationTracker`, `active_clouds: Sequence[ConfigCloud]`, and
`allocation_lock: asyncio.Lock`. The orchestrator SHALL own the tracker,
the filtered cloud config list, and the lock — constructing them once and
injecting them into use cases.

The `Orchestrator` SHALL NOT import `AllSSHRetryExc` or `backoff` from
`yascheduler.adapters` at runtime. The `Orchestrator` SHALL NOT apply
`@backoff.on_exception` decorators — all retry logic SHALL live in the
adapter.

The `Orchestrator` SHALL type `self._gateway` as `MachineGateway` (Protocol).
The orchestrator's `_start_task_on_machine` SHALL be a thin wrapper that
resolves `ncpus` via UoW (falling back to `gateway.get_cpu_cores()`) and
delegates the actual upload + spawn to `gateway.start_task_on_machine()`.
The orchestrator SHALL NOT contain any reference to adapter-specific
methods (`get_sftp`, `get_path`, `get_quote`, `run_full`).

The orchestrator SHALL NOT read `self._clouds.configs` — the filtered
`active_clouds` list is injected at construction. The orchestrator SHALL
NOT hold `adapters` or `configs` dicts — provider selection is delegated
to the `clouds.select_provider` port method.

#### Scenario: Orchestrator starts all loops
- **WHEN** `await orchestrator.start()` is called
- **THEN** all 4 loops begin executing concurrently, using `uow_factory` for all persistence queries and `gateway` for all SSH operations

#### Scenario: Graceful shutdown
- **WHEN** `await orchestrator.stop()` is called
- **THEN** all loops receive cancellation, pending queue items are drained, and connections are closed via gateway

#### Scenario: No adapter imports at runtime
- **WHEN** `orchestrator.py` is imported
- **THEN** it does NOT import `AllSSHRetryExc`, `SFTPRetryExc`, or `backoff` from `yascheduler.adapters` at runtime (TYPE_CHECKING imports are allowed)

#### Scenario: Task deployment delegated to gateway
- **WHEN** the orchestrator allocates a task to a machine
- **THEN** the orchestrator resolves `ncpus` via UoW and calls `gateway.start_task_on_machine(machine, engine, task, ncpus, self._config.remote.engines_dir)` — never touches `get_sftp`, `get_path`, or `get_quote` directly

### Requirement: Deallocate loop

The system SHALL identify idle cloud nodes via UoW, call `deallocate_nodes`
to disable them, then handle SSH disconnect and cloud deallocation for
returned IPs via `MachineGateway` and `CloudProvisioner`. The
`_deallocator_consumer` SHALL open a UoW to read the node, call
`deallocate_node(node, gateway, clouds, uow_factory)` which performs
disable + cloud delete + remove in two short UoWs bracketing the pure
cloud call. The orchestrator SHALL use `gateway.list_connected()` instead
of `gateway.items()` for iterating connected machines.

#### Scenario: Cloud node idle too long
- **WHEN** a cloud node has been free longer than `idle_tolerance` seconds
- **THEN** `deallocate_nodes` disables the node in DB and returns its IP for SSH cleanup and cloud deletion

#### Scenario: Deallocator uses list_connected
- **WHEN** `_deallocator_producer` iterates connected machines
- **THEN** it uses `gateway.list_connected()` and accesses `machine.ip` directly

#### Scenario: Deallocator consumer brackets cloud delete with UoWs
- **WHEN** `_deallocator_consumer` processes a disabled node IP
- **THEN** it reads the node via UoW, calls `deallocate_node` which disables via UoW, calls `clouds.deallocate(cloud, ip)`, then removes via a second UoW

### Requirement: Allocate loop

The system SHALL poll TO_DO tasks via UoW and dispatch to the
`allocate_task` use case with configured concurrency limits. The producer
SHALL load domain `Task` objects from `TaskRepository.list_by_status`. The
producer SHALL compute cloud capacity via the inline `_clouds_get_capacity`
method (UoW read of `uow.nodes.list_all()` + `Counter` over
`active_clouds`). SSH operations SHALL use `MachineGateway`. The
`_allocator_consumer` SHALL NOT apply `@backoff.on_exception` — retry
logic lives in the adapter.

#### Scenario: Task allocated in order
- **WHEN** multiple TO_DO tasks exist
- **THEN** tasks are allocated up to the configured `allocate_limit` concurrently

#### Scenario: Cloud capacity computed inline
- **WHEN** `_allocator_producer` determines the task limit
- **THEN** `_clouds_get_capacity` opens a UoW, reads `uow.nodes.list_all()`, counts nodes per cloud, and returns `max(0, sum(max_nodes for c in active_clouds) - sum(current_counts for c in active_clouds))`
