"""Platform detection — run adapter checks on a connected host, return first match and all matched platforms."""
# region MODULE_CONTRACT
# PURPOSE: Run adapter checks on a connected host, return first matching adapter and all matched platform tags.
# SCOPE: Platform detection by running each adapter's check sequence against the remote host.
# INVARIANTS: MAX_SESSIONS=10 is the default OpenSSH server MaxSessions — the semaphore cap matches the protocol's natural limit.
# DEPENDENCIES: USES API: asyncstdlib, asyncio.locks
# KEYWORDS: platform detection, adapter, detect, remote, checks
# endregion MODULE_CONTRACT

# region FUNC__detect_platform
# PURPOSE: Run adapter checks on connected host, return first match and all matched platforms.
# ENSURES: Raises PlatformGuessFailedError if no adapter matches.
# INVARIANTS: Uses asyncstdlib.all + asyncstdlib.map to run each adapter's checks tuple concurrently under a Semaphore(MAX_SESSIONS) — MAX_SESSIONS=10 is the default OpenSSH server MaxSessions; the first adapter whose checks all pass is the returned adapter; the platforms list collects every matching adapter's platform tag (a Debian-12 host matches linux, debian-like, debian, debian-12 — all four tags are returned so the orchestrator's engine filter sees them).
# RATIONALE:
# - Q: why run every adapter's checks even after the first match?
#   A: the platforms list (not just the chosen adapter.platform) is what the orchestrator's engine-filter reads — early exit would lose the multi-platform tags that let a Debian-12 host match a linux-only engine AND a debian-12-only engine.
# - Q: why a Semaphore(MAX_SESSIONS)?
#   A: the adapter checks open SSH channels concurrently; OpenSSH's default MaxSessions=10 caps concurrent channels per connection — exceeding it surfaces as ChannelOpenError (a retryable SSHRetryExc); the semaphore caps the concurrency at the source.
