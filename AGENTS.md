## Development Rules

- Follow the OpenSpec, YAGNI, DRY, KISS, SOLID principles.
- Top-down approach: Start with requirements and a bird's-eye view plan. Define
  module contracts with purpose and boundaries before any code. Specify
  contracts for public classes, methods, and functions. Create stubs. Only then
  write code inside the contracted regions.
- Public interface stability: CLI commands, public API, INI config format, DB
  schema. Schema changes MUST include migrations.
- NEVER modify `pyproject.toml` version; release automation owns it.
- Target Python `>=3.9`.
- To add new dependencies: FIRST declare them in an OpenSpec change proposal
  with rationale.
- Maintain compatibility with both `pip` and `uv`. Use only PEP 621 standard
  fields in `pyproject.toml`.
- Prefer minimal changes over broad refactors.
- Do not add compatibility layers without a concrete need.
- If a commit is required, format the message according to Conventional Commits.
- Every module should export only the public API via `__all__`.

## OpenSpec Rule

Any code, configuration, CLI, workflow, engine contract, cloud behavior, DB
schema, or operational behavior change must consult `openspec/specs/` before
implementation and update the relevant OpenSpec requirements in the same change.

Use `openspec/changes/` proposals for behavior-changing work before
implementation.

If the user requests changes outside the OpenSpec workflow, offer to use
OpenSpec via `/opsx-propose`, but do not block or refuse the requested work.

## Architectural Decisions Rule

Architectural trade-offs (module boundaries, data ownership, protocols,
tech/library selection, security model, failure/error handling,
identity/lifecycle design, dependency direction) must consult `docs/decisions/`
before implementation.

If a change introduces a new architectural trade-off with viable alternatives,
record it as a new ADR in `docs/decisions/` using `_template.md`. Sequential
numbering starts at the next free slot; no numbers are reserved. Bug fixes, file
relocations, test additions, spec maintenance, and feature work are not ADRs.

<!-- #region SECTION_Verification -->

## Verification

- New code should include focused unit tests for core logic and pure behavior;
  test happy paths first, then meaningful edge cases.
- For changes touching DB queries, node lifecycle, SSH interaction, or
  orchestrator flow, also add or update integration/e2e tests per the relevant
  OpenSpec specs.
- Run tests: `uv run pytest -m unit`, `uv run pytest -m integration`,
  `uv run pytest -m e2e`. Assume Docker is available and running, no pre-flight checks.
- Static checks: `uv run zuban check`, `uv run ruff check .`,
  `uv run ruff format --check .`, `uv run lint-imports`
- Spec validation: `openspec validate --all --json` must pass after creating a
  change proposal and after any modification to `openspec/specs/`, and also
  after archiving or syncing changes.
- Use testcontainers for integration and e2e tests (PostgreSQL, SSH). Avoid only
  uncontrolled production resources (real cloud accounts, production DBs, live
  SSH servers) unless explicitly requested and configured.

### Logging & Verification

Structured logs = primary observability. Block boundary log entries declare
what code assumes at that point. Runtime behavior traceable back to contract.

**Trace method.** Emit `logger.debug("BLOCK", extra={"k": v, ...})` at block
boundaries. The positional block marker is the debug message; structured fields
are the flat `extra` dict (no nested sentinel, no wrapper function). Structured
fields preferred; redact secrets. Missing trace logging on critical branches =
verification defect.

**Logger binding.** Modules bind loggers via stdlib:

```python
import logging
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
```

**Module-local logger names.** Modules obtain a logger via
logging.getLogger(**name**), which yields names like
`yascheduler.<dotted.module.path>`.

**Record contract for tests.** Trace records expose `getMessage()` and
structured fields as record attributes. Tests assert the block marker and extra
fields.

**Tests:** deterministic assertions first. Trace/log assertions when trajectory
matters. Module-local tests stay close to module. Update tests when log markers
change intentionally.

## Project

`yascheduler` schedules scientific calculation jobs on SSH machines and
cloud-created nodes. It provides a daemon, CLI tools, a Python client, and an
AiiDA scheduler plugin.

### Core Flow

1. A client or `yasubmit` creates a DB task with status `TO_DO`.
2. The daemon connects enabled nodes from `yascheduler_nodes`.
3. The allocator picks a compatible free node or requests a cloud node.
4. Inputs are uploaded, `spawn` starts remotely, and the task is `RUNNING`.
5. The daemon detects completion, downloads outputs, and marks `DONE`.
6. Idle cloud nodes are disabled and deleted after provider tolerance.

### Structure

Hexagonal architecture:
domain (no external deps) <- application <- infra <- entrypoints.

```txt
yascheduler/
├── entrypoints/  # drivers: cli, entrypoints, public API, DI
├── infra/        # driven: PSQL schema, UoW, ssh, cloud adapters, webhooks
├── application/  # use cases, orchestrator, message bus
├── domain/       # entities, ports, events, exceptions
└── shared/       # shared kernel
```
