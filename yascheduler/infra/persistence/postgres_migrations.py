"""Apply pending database schema/data migrations in forward-only order."""
# region MODULE_CONTRACT
# PURPOSE: Evolve the database schema and data forward in production — one migration per tracker-recorded transaction — so the team makes incremental, replayable changes without manual DDL scripting.
# SCOPE:
# - Forward-only DDL/DML migration application over sql/migrations/ via one pg8000 connection, one transaction per migration, with yascheduler_migrations tracker recording.
# - NOT: rollback / "down" path; NOT: migration generation tool; NOT: schema.sql generation tool; NOT: prefix_id uniqueness validation at runtime (a unit-test responsibility).
# INVARIANTS: The migration system is forward-only — once a row is recorded in yascheduler_migrations, the runner never deletes it and never reverses the migration; the runner does not validate prefix_id uniqueness across files — a unit test scanning the migrations directory asserts uniqueness; the schema.sql snapshot and individual migration files are hand-written, no tool generates either; apply_migrations is synchronous and opens a single pg8000 connection for the whole run.
# DEPENDENCIES: USES API: pg8000.Connection, READS: migration files (.sql, .py) from sql/migrations/, LOADS: Python migration modules dynamically via importlib
# RATIONALE:
# - Q: Why is the migration system forward-only with no down / rollback path?
#   A: Rolling back a migration in production typically requires data-loss decisions the runner cannot make (a column add cannot be reversed without dropping the column and its data; a data backfill cannot be reversed without the pre-image); the project ships a new forward migration to fix a bad one, and the yascheduler_migrations tracker row is the audit log of what landed.
# - Q: Why does the runner not validate prefix_id uniqueness at runtime?
#   A: A duplicate prefix_id is a static authoring defect — surfacing it via a unit test that scans the migrations directory gives the author feedback at CI time before the migration reaches any database, and keeps the runner's job (apply pending migrations) narrow.
# - Q: Why is there no migration generation tool?
#   A: Every migration in this project is small, schema-anchored, and hand-reviewed against the schema.sql snapshot (the Migration edit procedure requirement); auto-generation would couple the project to a schema-diff tool and bypass the human review that the snapshot-conformance step enforces.

# RATIONALE:
# - Q: Why filter by cls.__module__ == module.__name__ in addition to issubclass(cls, Migration)?
#   A: A .py migration file typically imports from yascheduler.infra.persistence.migration_base import Migration to declare its subclass — without the __module__ filter, Migration itself would appear as a class in the module and pollute the candidate list; filtering to classes defined locally to the migration file keeps the discovery exact.

# ENSURES: On success, a row (<prefix_id>, <default-timestamp>) exists in yascheduler_migrations and the migration's SQL is committed; on any error from BEGIN through COMMIT, issues best-effort ROLLBACK via _rollback(conn) and re-raises — no tracker row is inserted for the failed migration.

# region FUNC__record_py_tracker
# PURPOSE: Persist the tracker record for a .py migration after migrate() succeeds so the same step is never re-applied, even if the runner crashes after the SQL landed.
# INVARIANTS: Issues INSERT INTO yascheduler_migrations (migration_id) VALUES (:p) then COMMIT; on DatabaseError, reopens with BEGIN and retries the INSERT / COMMIT exactly once — the retry path handles transient DB-side errors like a deadlock on the tracker table; a non-transient failure such as a duplicate-prefix_id primary-key violation re-raises from the retry and surfaces the real defect.
# ENSURES: On success, the row (<prefix_id>, <default-timestamp>) exists in yascheduler_migrations; works in BOTH the normal case — migrate's transaction still open, the INSERT/COMMIT commits inside it — and the commit-closed case — migrate called self.commit() and did not reopen, the INSERT autocommits and the trailing COMMIT is a no-op warning rather than an error.
# RATIONALE:
# - Q: Why does the tracker record succeed in BOTH the normal case and the self.commit()-closed case?
#   A: pg8000 native AUTOCOMMITS statements issued outside an open transaction, and a bare COMMIT with no open transaction is a no-op warning rather than an error — so a Python migration that legitimately closed the runner's transaction for a non-transactional operation (CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY, VACUUM) is still tracker-recorded; the contract is "migrate() applied <=> tracker recorded".
# - Q: Why does the function retry the INSERT/COMMIT once on DatabaseError?
#   A: The retry is a defensive guard for transient DB-side errors on the tracker record (e.g. a deadlock between two concurrent yainit invocations); the reopen-and-retry turns a transient conflict into a success, while a non-transient failure (duplicate-prefix_id PK violation) re-raises from the retry and lets the caller's ROLLBACK handle it.

    # CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY), the INSERT below simply autocommits and

    #
    # The except-DatabaseError reopen branch is a defensive guard for

# INVARIANTS: Loads the migration module from path via importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(prefix_id, path) — the prefix_id is the module name, so a .py migration file is importable only by the runner, not by regular import statements; raises RuntimeError if the spec or loader is None; the runner opens BEGIN BEFORE loading the module, so a module-level statement that touches the DB (rare but legal) runs inside the migration's transaction.
# ENSURES: On success, the migration's migrate() body has run AND the tracker row for <prefix_id> is recorded (the tracker recording is delegated to _record_py_tracker); on any error from module load, migrate(), or tracker recording, issues best-effort ROLLBACK via _rollback(conn) and re-raises — no tracker row is inserted for the failed migration.
